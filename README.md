# Markdown to HTML Converter

This project provides a simple script, `markdown2html.py`, which converts Markdown files to HTML.

## Usage

To use the script, run the following command:

```sh
./markdown2html.py <input_markdown_file> <output_html_file>
```

### Arguments

1. `<input_markdown_file>`: The name of the Markdown file to be converted.
2. `<output_html_file>`: The name of the output HTML file.

### Requirements

- If the number of arguments is less than 2:
  - The script prints `Usage: ./markdown2html.py README.md README.html` to STDERR and exits with status 1.
- If the Markdown file doesnâ€™t exist:
  - The script prints `Missing <filename>` to STDERR and exits with status 1.
- Otherwise, the script performs the conversion, prints nothing, and exits with status 0.

## Installation

1. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.
2. Install the `markdown` module using the following command:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-markdown
```

3. Make the script executable:

```sh
chmod +x markdown2html.py
```

## Example

Convert `README.md` to `README.html`:

```sh
./markdown2html.py README.md README.html
```

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language created by John Gruber in 2004, with the goal of enabling people "to write using an easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain text format, and optionally convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)." It allows writers to format text using a simple and intuitive syntax, making it a popular choice for documentation, web content, and technical writing.

### Purpose of Markdown

The primary purpose of Markdown is to provide an easy way to format plain text documents without needing to write complex HTML code. It is designed to be readable as plain text, while also being easy to convert to HTML and other formats.

### Fun Things You Can Do with Markdown

1. **Create Rich Text Documents:** You can easily create documents with headers, lists, bold and italic text, links, images, and more.
2. **Write Blog Posts:** Many blogging platforms support Markdown, making it easy to write and format posts.
3. **Technical Documentation:** Tools like GitHub and GitLab use Markdown for README files and other documentation.
4. **Presentations:** Tools like Reveal.js allow you to create presentations using Markdown.
5. **Static Site Generators:** Use Markdown with static site generators like Jekyll or Hugo to build static websites.
6. **Note-Taking:** Applications like Obsidian, Notion, and Roam Research use Markdown for efficient and organized note-taking.

### Common Operations in Markdown

1. **Headers:**
    ```markdown
    # H1
    ## H2
    ### H3
    #### H4
    ##### H5
    ###### H6
    ```

2. **Emphasis:**
    ```markdown
    *italic* or _italic_
    **bold** or __bold__
    ```

3. **Lists:**
    - **Unordered Lists:**
      ```markdown
      - Item 1
      - Item 2
      - Item 3
      ```
    - **Ordered Lists:**
      ```markdown
      1. First item
      2. Second item
      3. Third item
      ```

4. **Links:**
    ```markdown
    [link text](http://example.com)
    ```

5. **Images:**
    ```markdown
    ![alt text](http://example.com/image.jpg)
    ```

6. **Blockquotes:**
    ```markdown
    > This is a blockquote.
    ```

7. **Code:**
    - **Inline Code:**
      ```markdown
      `code`
      ```
    - **Code Blocks:**
      ```markdown
      ```
      code block
      ```
      ```

8. **Horizontal Rule:**
    ```markdown
    ---
    ```

9. **Tables:**
    ```markdown
    | Header 1 | Header 2 |
    |----------|----------|
    | Cell 1   | Cell 2   |
    | Cell 3   | Cell 4   |
    ```

10. **Task Lists:**
    ```markdown
    - [ ] Task 1
    - [x] Task 2
    ```

### Markdown Implementations and Extensions

Many tools and platforms have extended Markdown to include additional features not found in the original specification. Some examples include:

- **GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM):** Adds support for syntax highlighting in code blocks, task lists, tables, and more.
- **CommonMark:** A standardized version of Markdown with a detailed specification to ensure consistent behavior across different implementations.
- **Pandoc:** A universal document converter that supports Markdown and many other formats, enabling complex transformations and extensions.

Markdown's simplicity and flexibility make it a versatile tool for a wide range of writing and documentation needs.
